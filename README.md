# Extension Usages
This extension is a customized information panel for outcomes from Rhino-Grasshopper-Ladybug to better manipulate the scene and visualize the data.
Additionally, it shows a possibility and develops a workflow to build digital twins which can extract any critical information for required components of the project, like the solar panels in this case, directly from GH to OV.

## About HNADI-AECKIT Platform
The HNADI-AECKIT Platform is a framework and collection of useful tools(Omniverse extensions) customized for general and special projects in the AEC industry. 
The main function of this platform is to offer a more detailed, data-visualizing, and interactive scene based on traditional DCC models.
It is basically the first attempt to realize the concept of Digital Twins for the AEC industry with Omniverse, which is extremely meaningful from our perspective.
The platform is fully built on Omniverseâ€”Kit and all its functions will be developed by our team HNADI in the future. 
Welcome to download and try!
